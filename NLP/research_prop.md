## Motivation

Word meaning changes based on linguistic and cultural context. Contextual embeddings like BERT have improved how models capture this dynamic nature. However, the question of how meaning shifts across contexts and languages remains under-explored. 

This project focuses on investigating how specific words vary in meaning depending on usage and linguistic background, with emphasis on polysemy and cultural interpretation.

## Related Work

Recent work on contextual word representations demonstrates that modern models can adjust word meaning based on sentence context. Multilingual models aim to align semantic spaces across languages.

Despite this, very few studies show how words behave when used in different contexts and across languages. There is little research into how culturally sensitive words drift semantically in these embedding spaces.

---

## Research Gap

Current multilingual models assume static linguistic equivalence. This fails for polysemous or socio-culturally nuanced words. There is not enough understanding of:

- How the same word changes its meaning across contexts.
- How different languages encode the same concept.
- The extent to which embeddings are modified based on cultural semantics.

## Research Direction

### Goal
Investigate and report how word meanings vary with context and language in multilingual embedding models.

### Objectives

1. Determine semantic drift of target words across contexts and languages.
2. Compare cross-lingual embeddings of culturally significant terms.
3. Visualize semantic shifts.
4. Identify patterns in divergence for specific word types (e.g., emotions, social roles).

## Methodology

### Data

- **Languages**: English, Hindi, French, Spanish  
- **Sources**: Wikipedia, OpenSubtitles, other corpora

### Embeddings

- **Models**: XLM-R (Trained on 100+ languages), LaBSE (Language-agnostic sentence encoder)  
- **Tools**: HuggingFace Transformers for tokenization and embedding extraction

### Analysis Techniques

- Nearest neighbor tracking to analyze local semantic space
- UMAP / t-SNE for visualization of contextual embeddings (after PCA)
- Semantic axis projections (e.g., sentiment, formality)

### Evaluation Metrics

- Visualization of clustered spaces
- Cosine / Jaccard similarity and other semantic drift measures
- Clustering entropy for polysemy estimation

## Potential Impact

This research will improve understanding of how language models interpret semantics across cultures and contexts. It may contribute to enhancements in multilingual NLP applications, including:

- Machine translation systems  
- Conversational agents  
- Cross-lingual information retrieval and search engines
