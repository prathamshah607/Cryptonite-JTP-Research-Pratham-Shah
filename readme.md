# Pratham Shah Taskphase repo for the Cryptonite Research Subsystem

Heart Dataset:
1. Linear Regression
2. vanilla Logistic Regression
3. Hierarchichal classification using cross val and multiple models - winner.

Electricity Dataset:
1. LSTM
2. XGBoost - winner.
3. RandomForestRegressor

Because the EDA and feature engineering are same for all the files, I have commented their details majorly in the LSTM file for electricity and the Hierarchical classifier in the heart dataset.
